# Silicon Valley Fan Site

A fan website of the HBO’s hit TV series, Silicon Valley. I really liked this show :)

Clone the repository to your PC and open the index.html file to interact with the website. The email function will only work if you run the website on a localhost server such as XAMPP.

### Prerequisites

For emails to work: 2. A localhost service such as XAMPP for local use

OR

2. Internet connection to shoot an email at https://svfansite.netlify.app/

### Installing

For the email to work (PHP executable):

1. Download and install XAMPP.
2. Move Repo File to htdocs folder of XAMPP.
3. Run XAMPP servers
4. Go to localhost/**_Silicon-Valley-Fan-Site-master_**

**Instructions on the setup and use of XAMPP will vary depending on your version.\*
\*\***Adjust url according to the file name if it is changed.\*\*\*

PS. Netlify forms is used for data collection rather than PHP since Netlify doesn't support server-side executions.
